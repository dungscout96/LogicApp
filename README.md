A Java program to identify properties of sentences and arguments of truth-functional logic.
Download the file *LogicApp.jar* for the application

## Instruction
The program only aims to evaluate the structure of a sentence or argument, not a natural sentence. 
Truth functional connectives supported are *if*, *and*, *or*, *not*.
A statement is represented by letters "a-z&A-Z".
A sentence can start with a statement or a connective. Sentence can be simple or compound. Examples of valid input:
- and(a,b)
- if(a,not(b))
- and(not(a),or(a,c))

There are three tests you can do with this program: Equivalency Test, Sentence Type, and Validity Test.
