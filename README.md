# LogicApp
Built as an interdisciplinary project connecting Philosophy and Computer Science while taking Logic class, LogicApp is a Java program that can (1) evaluate logical equivalency among sentence forms, (2) determine the logical properties of a sentence (tautology, contradiction, or contingent), and (3) test for validity of an argument. All evaluations are made by simulating truth table.

### Input format ###
Truth functional connectives supported are **if**, **and**, **or**, **not**.
The program only takes sentence variables, not a natural sentence. The variable letter can be lowercase or uppercase.
A sentence can be atomic or compound. Compound sentence should be written in the form _connective_(_sentence1_ [,_sentence2_]). Examples of valid input:
- a
- c
- and(a,b)
- if(a,not(b))
- and(not(a),or(a,c))
